Build a working blog site
-------------------------

Your task, should you choose to accept, is to build a simple blogging site using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and Apache. You will need to checkin your code to Github, so we can pull down the final result and run it locally. This means the entire codebase and any configuration files should be checked in. The following conditions must be met:

- create a public github repository and checkin your code there
- the blog should be written using Django & Python
- the database powering your blog should be PostgreSQL
- the blog should allow multple users to log in
- staff users can write blog articles
- all users can comment on blog articles
- a blog article consists of a three parts: title, body, slug, and date

- each blog article should have a link to a post page, where the URL is mysite.com/{URL_SLUG_FOR_POST}/
- site should be served via Apache and WSGI
